### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**andrew-osborne-sonarsource/andrew-osborne-sonarsource** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting up GitHub and building a library of projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to set up GitHub with SonarCloud
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on learning experiences
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about SonarLint, what it is like to work at Sonar
- âš¡ Fun fact: I work better with headphones and an espresso
